What is Create: Let The Adventure Begin?

Create: Let The Adventure Begin is an add-on for Create that implements naturally generating structures with create
mod features. The focus of this add-on is to make the world more fun to explore and worthwhile on an Create mod
aspect. It also offers a new way to kickstart your Create mod adventure by showcasing some of the uses of the Create
mod. This could include something like the rare windmill, which demonstrates the power of sails and windmill bearings
(check out the gallery for a preview of some of the structures).
